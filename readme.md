This code is inspired by Richard Dawkins' book The Blind Watchmaker.
I tried to simulate evolution of a watch but I wouldn't argue that the code works exactly as evolution does one thing which is wrong is that the system knows what will the end result be in the beggining this is not the case in evolution. But the script checks if only a charachter is same at an instant which I think is pretty good when it comes to simulating evolution.
